```

+1     +2   5  4
Full moon sway-s.
5    4 4 6   5
Gent-ly in the night
4 4  6   5  4
of one fine da-y.

7  +2 5  4
On my wa-y.
6    4  4 6
Look-ing for a
6  4    4  6 5  4
mo-ment with my de-ar.

7     +2  5   4
Full moon wav-es.
6    4 4 6   5    4
Slow-ly on the sur-face
4 6   5  4
of the la-ke.

7   +2   5  4
You were the-re.
6    4  4 6  5
Smil-ing in my arms
4  4   6    5  4
for all those ye-ars.

6    +1  +3
What a fool.
6  +3    +2     +1
I don't know 'bout
+2  +2  +1
to-mor-row.
+1    +1    +1  5  6
What it's like to be.
6 6 5
Ah-h-h...

6  +1   +3
I was fool.
6     +3   +2  +1   +2
Could-n't let my-self
+2 +1
to go.
+1     +1   +1 5
Even though I feel,
6   5
the end.

7    +2  5   4
Old love af-fair.
6     4   4  6  5
Float-ing like a  bird
4   4  6   5  4
rest-ing her win-gs.

7   +2   5  4
You were the-re.
6    4  4 6  5
Smil-ing in my arms
4  4   6    5  4
for all those ye-ars.
